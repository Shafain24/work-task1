In Node.js, the event loop manages execution order. Syncronous code runs first, so "Start", "Syncronous", and "End" print immedietely. Promises create microtasks that execute after syncronous code but before any timers, so "Promise 1" and "Promise 2" come next. setTimeout callbacks are macrotasks and run only after all syncronous code and microtasks complete. Even a setTimeout with 0ms delay waits for microtasks to finish, which is why "Timeout 0ms" appears after the Promises. The setTimeout with 10ms delay executes last. This shows Node.js priority: syncronous code then microtasks and finally  macrotasks, showing why Promises always execute before timers and how asyncronous operations are handeled in the event loop.
